## üß† Product Overview

ConnectWise RMM is a remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform tailored for managed service providers (MSPs) and support teams. It allows for endpoint monitoring, patch deployment, automated remediation, scripting, and real-time alerting. The platform also integrates with tools like Auvik for network topology and BrightGauge for in-depth reporting and analytics.

## üîß Technical Breakdown & Features

### üîπ Sites & Grouping Functionality
- **Sites** structure endpoint environments by client or location, giving admins better control over monitoring, automation, and reporting per group.
- **Static Groups**: Manually populated with selected devices.
- **Dynamic Groups**: Populated automatically based on custom fields or predefined criteria (OS type, device type, last login, etc.). Dynamic groups are ideal for targeting automation or policies at scale.

### üîπ Patch Management & Automation
- Patch tasks are deployable manually or through **triggered policies**.
- Patching supports both OS-level (e.g., Windows Updates) and third-party software (e.g., Java, Adobe).
- **Policy-Based Automation**:
  - Define behavior like ‚ÄúDeploy missing patches on detection.‚Äù
  - Can be set to reboot after patching, log results, or send notifications.
- Scripts and remediation tasks are integrated and executable across endpoints using pre-set schedules or conditions.

### üîπ CVE & Vulnerability Integration
- ConnectWise RMM includes built-in CVE monitoring under the **Vulnerabilities** tab.
- Displays matching CVEs with severity scores, descriptions, and remediation paths.
- Some CVEs are patchable directly from the interface; others provide technical remediation guidance.

### üîπ Script Execution & Remote Actions
- Admins can run scripts (PowerShell, Bash, Batch) remotely across selected endpoints.
- Scripts are categorized into tasks (e.g., cleanup, diagnostics, updates).
- Supports chained actions based on trigger conditions (e.g., CPU usage exceeds X%).

### üîπ Auvik Network Monitoring Integration
- **Auvik** integration auto-discovers all IP-reachable assets in the network.
- Provides a **visual network topology map**, including online/offline status, device roles (e.g., routers, firewalls), and connection paths.
- Enables proactive monitoring of critical infrastructure devices.
- Network maps are exportable for documentation or offline analysis.

### üîπ BrightGauge Reporting & Analytics
- BrightGauge provides **custom dashboards** and **machine-level analytics**.
- Reports (called ‚Äúgauges‚Äù) can be built from patch data, system performance metrics, or vulnerability exposure.
- Reports are interactive, exportable, and can be scheduled for automated delivery.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tier 1 Support Use Case: Patch Failure with CVE Association

**Scenario**: A dynamic group reports a failed patch deployment. A matching CVE (critical severity) is listed in the vulnerability dashboard.

**Steps Taken**:
1. Navigate to device group policy to confirm it includes auto-patching behavior.
2. Check endpoint patch logs and remediation task outcomes.
3. Cross-reference CVE details with ConnectWise guidance to assess manual remediation needs.
4. Run a remediation script to deploy patch manually.
5. Confirm patch success and close alert. Escalate to Tier 2 if repeat failure or reboot loop occurs.
6. Document all steps in PSA with timestamps and logs.

## üìå Final Takeaways

This demo emphasized how ConnectWise RMM combines alert-driven support workflows with flexible policy automation. By integrating Auvik for network intelligence and BrightGauge for analytics, it enables Tier 1 and Tier 2 teams to respond quickly to performance issues, vulnerabilities, and patch compliance failures.
